# Agent Instructions (foxmemory-deploy)

## Priority
1. Keep deployment examples reproducible.
2. Keep one-node and split modes both functional.
3. Document all env vars and defaults.

## Rules
- Never hardcode private credentials.
- Keep compose files minimal and explicit.
- Update README + runbook when topology changes.
